# Simple HTTP server
\# Multithreaded http server \# 0 Dependencies

Once you have rust installed `cargo run`

This will make the server listen to 127.0.0.1:7878.
Use 127.0.0.1:7878 as a url in your browser

Feel free to modify hello.html to serve whatever
Also you can test the multithreaded ability with the 127.0.0.1:7878/sleep URL, this will wait 5 seconds before sending the response.
